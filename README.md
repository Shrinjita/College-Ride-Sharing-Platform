# College-Ride-Sharing-Platform
The College Ride Sharing Platform is a secure, student-only ride-pooling service designed to make commuting cost-effective, safe, and convenient for college students. It allows users to schedule rides, match with verified students, opt for gender-specific pooling, split fares, and send emergency SOS alerts for enhanced security.
